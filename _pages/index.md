I don't know.

## This is the homepage of Zhukang

This page is still under development, and the following is all test content.

 Notice that $ a+b=c $ and we obtain:

$$ \Gamma(z) = \int_{0}^{\infty} t^{z-1}\mathrm{e}^{-t}\, \mathrm{d} t\,. $$

For inline code we can use `int a=0;` , for another way we can use

```java
for (Element e : c) {
    doSomething(e);
}

//before JDK1.5
for (Iterator i = c.iterator(); i.hasNext(); ) {
    doSomething((Element) i.next());doSomething((Element) i.next());doSomething((Element) i.next());doSomething((Element) i.next());doSomething((Element) i.next());doSomething((Element) i.next());doSomething((Element) i.next());doSomething((Element) i.next());doSomething((Element) i.next());doSomething((Element) i.next());
}
```
